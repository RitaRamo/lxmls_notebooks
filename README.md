# LxMLS Notebooks

Notebooks of the Lisbon Machine Learning School 2008 (LxMLS 2018).

The guide of LxMLS presents assignments for each day of the week and, thereby, I implemented a notebook for each day. The notebooks have the following contents (see more specifically in the guide):

Day 1: Linear Classifiers 
  * Generative Classifiers: Naive Bayes
  * Discriminative Classifiers
    * Perceptron
    * Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) 
    * Maximum Entropy Classifiers 
    * Support Vector Machines

Day 2: Sequence Models
 *  Hidden Markov Models 
 * The forward backward algorithm 
 * Viterbi algorithm 
 * Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS) 
 * Unsupervised Learning of HMMs 

Day 3: Non-Linear Classifiers
 * Deriving Gradients in Computation Graphs using the Chain Rule 
 * The Multilayer Perceptron
 * Backpropagation 
 * Deriving gradients and GPU code with Pytorch

Day 4: Learning Structured Predictors 
 * Conditional Random Fields
 * Structured Perceptron
