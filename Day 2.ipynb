    "Consider a person who is only interested in four activities: walking in the park (walk), shopping (shop), cleaning the apartment (clean) and playing tennis (tennis). Also, consider that the choice of what the person does on a given day is determined exclusively by the weather on that day, which can be either rainy or sunny. Now, supposing that we observe what the person did on a sequence of days, the question is: can we use that information to predict the weather on each of those days? To tackle this problem, we assume that the weather behaves as a discrete Markov chain: the weather on a given day depends only on the weather on the previous day. The entire system can be described as an HMM.\n",
    "For example, assume we are asked to predict the weather conditions on two different sequences of days. During these two sequences, we observed the person performing the following activities:\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> “walk walk shop clean” </li>\n",
