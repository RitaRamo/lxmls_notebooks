    "In this simple exercise, you will see the CKY algorithm in action. There is a Javascript applet that illus- trates how CKY works (in its non-probabilistic form). Go to http://lxmls.it.pt/2015/cky.html, and observe carefully the several steps taken by the algorithm. Write down a small grammar in CNF that yields multiple parses for the ambiguous sentence The man saw the boy in the park with a telescope, and run the demo for this particular sentence. What would happen in the probabilistic form of CKY?"

As we can observe, given to the ambiguity of this sentence, the algorithm was not able to parse it. That is why a probabilist form of CKY would be better, in order to output the most likely parse tree.\n",
